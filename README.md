# Overview

Repository contains neural network implementation described in `Make Your Own Neural Network` book written on pure C# language without any third party libraries.

This network have been made just for academic purpose.

As part of the work there was written helper project for matrix operations like: addition, multiplication and so one. It works as designed, however, it could be much faster if it had been written using [AVX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions) processor instructions.
